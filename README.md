# CTF-misc
random ctf scripts and what not

in CoR-CTF has the source code + solve for the challenge I wrote
in DD2 there is the exploit source for dream diary 2  
in pico2021 I have the three chromium challenges and their solves (d8 not included as its a big file)
and rope has the source for foothold pwn, user pwn(?), and root pwn ( you will need to use dmesg for the libc leak ( I was a pwn noob then ))
